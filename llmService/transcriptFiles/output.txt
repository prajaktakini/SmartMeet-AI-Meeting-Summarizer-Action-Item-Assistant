So let's go over our action items for this week. So the first thing that I have is There's a bug that has been reported by the user. and apparently trade UI is slow. And it gets slow for like certain queries And so I think the issue maybe is not maybe in the UI layer, but like maybe in the middleware where in the elastic query it may be some having some issues there So I think that's where we should look. So yeah, I mean… Shamir, can you pick that up? for next week i think we should resolve it pretty soon. So keep this on a high priority. Okay, thank you. Yeah. The other thing like uh apart from that um
Yeah. The other thing like uh apart from that um there's an enhancement that we can made to our contract store publisher. and basically right now we are right now publishing the payment objects But once the trade gets cancelled or the trade gets over, the invalid payments, they need to be cancelled. So we should make a flow or make an announcement to publish the cancellations. of those objects as well. So I think that can be really helpful with that data um you know getting a data consistent as well so yeah let's get on it. I think… Dinkya Rahul, you can pick that up. This is like a medium priority, you know, test it out well and Yeah, we can like maybe in the next two weeks We can discuss whatever you have thought.
We can discuss whatever you have thought. All right. So now let's talk. So my updates. I was looking on the infrastructure migration and I was able to run the trade booking application and rel7 host. And yeah, so I'm basically working from continuing my work from last week. And it's expected to complete maybe within the next week. that you get it done and move on to my next task. So one thing I also noticed was we can make certain, you know. announcement on the trade UI. One of them is the page size. So currently we are loading like 50 trades whenever a user hits the search button And I think users would like to see
And I think users would like to see a little bit more so maybe like we can increase that to from 50 to 100. So yeah, let's try that i think that is that can be like a straightforward task like one take long. It's going to be, you know, in the next couple of days we can try to get it done. So yeah, let me know whoever wants to pick that and Yeah. Let's get started on it. Cool. Okay. So those were like all the action items that i had No. there is one more thing on the agenda. And yeah, so we have a deem dinner plan tomorrow so Make sure you guys are there. All right.
